# Cholesky_CUDA
### GPU implementation of Cholesky decomposition

##### This file contains code for running Cholesky decomposition on a GPU. It was created and run in Visual Studio 2019 with the CUDA 11.0 development kit installed.

The input matrix gets defined in the code. It can be either randomly-generated or there are select pre-defined matrices. There is support for both integer and float matrices.
The size of the matrix need to be set in order for the program to run properly. This is accomplished through changing the value of the int N in the runCholesky functions.
